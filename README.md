# GCALBOT

- Behaviour
    - Automatically Push, Pull and Sync every 24 hrs
    - Assign use name strings as ids to matching events in both places so if one changes it can sync
    - keep as persistent data
- Per Server Data
    - A specific calendar to sync
- Commands
    - Push command (puts discord events in gcal)
    - Pull command (pulls gcal events into discord)
    - Sync command (syncs info of all events with the same names)
    - Plans command (spits out a list of whats happening the next 2 weeks with day of week)
- Events
    - location
    - date and time
    - name of event

TODO:
improve efficiency o(n^2) time for push and pull. comebine into a sync somehow maybe?
better implementation for a blank default location
add privacy or role checks to ensure privacy and allow the bot to be used in public servers safely (use implementation from match bot)


needs token and calendar_id in the .env file. needs a .credentials folder at the root of the project with the google oauth service for authentication according to the gcsa library
